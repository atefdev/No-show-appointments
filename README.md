# NO-Show Appointments Data Analysis
This project is part of the tasks in the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree, and aims to practice the skills learned during the course.

A person makes a doctor appointment, receives all the instructions and no-show. Who to blame?

In this project, a dataset of appointment records in public hospitals at Vitoria, Brazil is investigated. The reason why the patient did not show up attracts our attention. This dataset contains records whether patients miss appointments, attributes of patients and information about appointments. The data set is provided on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments).

Through this project we will try to answer some questions about the reasons for patients miss appointments.

The whole project is developed within [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) and the data is imported and worked using the [Pandas library](https://pandas.pydata.org/) of the [Python language ](https://www.python.org/).
